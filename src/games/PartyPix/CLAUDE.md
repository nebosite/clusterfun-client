# PartyPix — architecture notes

A ClusterFun game (presenter + client on one shared module). Read [DESIGN.md](DESIGN.md) first for
the product flow, economy, and visual spec; this file is how the code implements it. Built from the
`TestGame` template.

## The loop

`join → snap → confirm → upload (−1 credit) → shows on the slideshow → others up/down/flag →
3 upvotes = +1 credit → snap more.` Continuous/arcade — no rounds. The presenter owns all state.

## Key design decisions

**All economy/slideshow rules are pure functions in `partyPixLogic.ts`.** The models hold the
observable state and delegate every decision (vote acceptance, credit crossings, delete threshold,
slide index math) to these functions, so the rules are unit-tested without the framework — mirrors
RetroSpectro's `groupNaming.ts`. When changing a rule, change it there and update its spec.

**Photo transport = downscaled base64 over the relay.** The server stores nothing. On upload the
phone produces a **full** JPEG (long edge ≤ 1200, q≈0.7) for the slideshow and a small **thumb**
(≤ 256) for phones, and sends both via `PartyPixUploadEndpoint`. The full image never leaves the
presenter; only the thumb is pushed to phones (`PartyPixSlideInfo.thumb`) for the "now showing"
strip. Keeps per-message and per-client traffic modest.

**Photos are never serialized to the checkpoint.** `saveCheckpoint()` persists to localStorage;
base64 images would blow the quota. The presenter type helper returns `shouldStringify(...) === false`
for `photos`, and the client excludes `currentSlide`/`myVotes`/`myFlags`. Players (credits/`totalUp`)
do persist. A refreshed client re-pulls everything via `requestGameStateFromPresenter` (onboard).

**Photos persist on disk (optional folder).** The presenter can save photos to a folder the host
picks, so the slideshow survives a refresh and returns between sessions. This is separate from the
checkpoint:

- `models/photoStoreLogic.ts` — PURE rules: which files count as photos, the `partypix-<t>-<n>.jpg`
  naming, and the sidecar index (`partypix-index.json`: uploaded files → author/createdAt, plus a
  `hidden` list). Unit-tested.
- `models/PhotoStore.ts` — browser glue over the **File System Access API** (`showDirectoryPicker`)
  - **IndexedDB** (remembers the directory handle). Chromium-only; `isSupported()` gates it and the
    game falls back to in-memory elsewhere. Also generates phone thumbnails from loaded images
    (canvas, via `imageUtil.scaleImageToJpeg`).
- Flow: `reconstitute()` calls `initPhotoStore()` → `PhotoStore.restore()` reads the remembered
  handle and `queryPermission()` (no prompt). `granted` (same-session refresh) → load silently;
  `prompt`/`denied` (new session after a browser restart) → `folderStatus = "needsReconnect"`, the
  join screen shows a one-click **Reconnect** button (`requestPermission` needs a gesture); no handle
  → the join screen shows **Choose a folder** + an "include existing photos?" checkbox
  (`showDirectoryPicker`, also gesture). So a mid-session refresh never re-asks; a new session is one
  click and never re-picks the folder.
- On upload, `handleUpload` writes the full JPEG to the folder off the response path and records the
  file name on the `PartyPixPhoto`. On load, `loadPhotosFromDisk` rebuilds `photos` from the folder
  (uploaded files keep their author from the index; pre-existing images appear only if "include
  existing" was chosen, with no author). Disk-loaded photos have `authorId = ""`, so nobody is
  credited for votes on them and `youAuthored` is false for everyone.
- **Safety:** removal only ever DELETES files PartyPix created (`managed`); flagging a pre-existing
  folder image just adds it to the sidecar `hidden` list — a user's own photos are never destroyed.

**Messaging.** Client→presenter requests: `Onboard` (pull full state on join/reconnect/invalidate),
`Upload` (echoes authoritative credits), `Vote` (`up`/`down`/`delete`, echoes tally). Presenter→
clients fire-and-forget pushes: `SlidePush` (current slide changed — sent to everyone, `youAuthored`
filled per recipient) and `CreditsPush` (a player's credit standing moved — broadcast so each phone
reads its own; there is no single-player send in the base class). The presenter is authoritative;
clients update optimistically and reconcile on the echo/push.

**Credits.** `totalUp` is monotonic lifetime upvotes; a credit is granted each time it crosses a
multiple of `UPVOTES_PER_CREDIT` (3), capped at `CREDIT_CAP` (9). Retracting or switching a vote
never reduces `totalUp` (stay positive). You can't vote your own photo; one up/down and one flag per
player per photo; re-tapping a direction toggles it off. **Anti-farming:** each voter can move a
photo's author toward a credit **at most once** — `applyVote` tracks a per-photo `creditedVoters`
set and only the first upvote from a given voter returns `countsForCredit`, so an accomplice can't
mint credits by toggling one upvote. So `totalUp` counts _distinct_ approvers, i.e. breadth.

**MobX.** Photo vote membership is plain `Set`s (for enforcement, consumed by the pure `applyVote`)
with mirrored `@observable` counts (`up`/`down`/`deleteCount`) updated via `syncCounts()` so the
presenter's live tally re-renders. All model mutations run inside `action(() => …)()`.

## State machine

- Presenter: `Gathering` (join screen / 0 photos) → `Slideshow` on first upload → back to
  `Gathering` if all photos are removed. `minPlayers = 1`; no host "start" gate — the first photo
  starts the show. Players may join during `Gathering` and `Slideshow`.
- Client: joins → `Playing` (base `Gathering`/`Slideshow` both map here), with `viewMode`
  `capture` | `vote`. Out-of-credits is the Capture view with the action disabled.

## Running / testing

- Dev Test Lobby: `npm start` → pick **PartyPix**. On desktop the camera input becomes a file
  picker, so you can test the whole loop without a phone. PartyPix is registered in the **debug**
  game list (`gamesListDebug.ts`), so it's dev-only until added to the server manifest + release list.
- Tests: `npm test`. Pure rules in `partyPixLogic.spec.ts`; image fit in `imageUtil.spec.ts`.

## Known limitations (tracked, non-blocking for the MVP)

- **Sybil / identity-churn farming.** `creditedVoters` keys on `playerId`. Rejoin-by-name restores a
  player's persisted `totalUp`/credits but assigns a **new** `playerId`, which isn't in an old
  photo's `creditedVoters` — so someone who deliberately disconnects/rejoins under the same name
  could re-credit the same photo (and inflate its `up` tally). Inherent to any identity-based abuse
  guard; fine for friends-at-a-party, worth revisiting only if PartyPix ships to untrusted rooms.
- **Rapid uploads can starve rotation.** Each upload jumps the show to the newest photo and resets
  the 6s timer, so at a busy party older photos may rarely display until uploads pause. Intentional
  "instant gratification" for the MVP; revisit ordering (see cut-lines) if it's a problem in play.
- **Reconnecting a folder mid-show is a visible reset.** `loadPhotosFromDisk` rebuilds the array
  and sets `currentIndex = 0` (the slideshow snaps back to photo 1), and reloaded photos get
  `authorId = ""` (author names survive via the sidecar, but the original author loses `youAuthored`
  / future-credit on those photos). A host should ideally connect the folder on the join screen
  before the party starts.
- **Very narrow load-race.** An upload landing during the async `loadPhotosFromDisk` enumeration can
  be dropped from the live array by the following `clear()`; its file still persists and reappears
  on the next load (no data loss). Gated to gesture/startup moments — unlikely in practice.

## Known cut-lines (deferred from the MVP)

Strict round-robin-by-author ordering (MVP shows newest-on-upload, then simple rotation), QR join
code, host start-gate + best-of montage, mini-leaderboard, animated transitions, most-upvoted
weighting, and EXIF-orientation handling on captured photos. See DESIGN.md §MVP cut-lines.
(Cross-reload photo persistence is now **implemented** via the optional on-disk folder above; vote
tallies are still session-only.)
