            - Items
                - Always make your ‘Call to Action’ the most prominent item on the screen
                - subtle borders and shadows to group items
                - white spacing between stuff
                - Better onboarding with a "skip" option
        [ ] Smaller font for cards is ok (could be 30% smaller)
        [ ] Allow skipping of initial instructions
        [ ] Provide some examples
        [ ] Send end of game to clients so they invite the user to quit
        [ ] Show time left on client
        [ ] Some people feel bad not getting to see what other's write
            - Don't want to forget about something
            - Lightning round - the thing I forgot
            [ ] Button to return and get more answers
    
    
        [ ] Extra stage - do you need more time?
        [ ] Have an animation to show reordering of categories
        [ ] https on the server  (letsencrypt)
        [ ] Presenter is too big - there is a scroll bar 
            [ ] root is hard set to 1080 pm - should be 100%
        
        [ ] Click on card to bookmark it
        [ ] Maybe a ven diagram?
        [ ] E2E encryption
        [ ] Business: on-prem docker image
