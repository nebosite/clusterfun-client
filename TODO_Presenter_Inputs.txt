TODO: Since there are a lot of lifecycle management inputs here,
consider carefully how you want to implement the communications.
Note that we actually have to do have to implement the whole lifecycle
(rather than just starting the game, as in Jackbox) because we need
to be able to control it when a controllable presenter is not available.
